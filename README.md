Makes ordering DME easy

This web app will allow therapists and doctors to coordinate DME orders, quickly and easily. Therapists can use a browser on any device to place orders for their patients. The physicians at the facility will be able to see all the orders placed, sign them, and submit it to any DME provider they choose. The DME provider will have all the information they need to fill the order. 

The physicians, therapists, and DME providers now have access to all orders that were placed and when they were filled. What used to take days, even weeks, can now be done within a matter of minutes!
